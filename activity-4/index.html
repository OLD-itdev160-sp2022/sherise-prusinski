            <h3>Alice Wonderland</h3>
            <p>
                It's been more than 3 years I am working on NetBeans and I am very satisfied.<br>
                It helped me in developing multiple projects and especially integration with Ant, SVN, JEE servers and
                Maven. <br>
                It is highly recommended to new developers.<br>
                <br>
                <i>Pros:</i>
                <br>
                NetBeans is very well organized in terms of code development and java web development.<br>
                It works on different platforms like Windows and Linux. <br>
                The best part of NetBeans is that it has visual web pack feature. <br>
                It comes with a lot of useful features such as debugging, code completion, multiple programming language
                support, integration and plugins. <br>
                It's integration is awesome with other tools. The best feature of this product is source control
                management like GitHub and other version control tools.<br>
                <br>
                <i>Cons:</i>
                <br>
                Sometimes NetBeans crash when used for a long period, which is frustrating. <br>
                It does not come with any professional support but one can easily join different groups or take help
                from seniors or from different forums. <br>
                While working on big projects it consumes a lot of memory space and slow down other system
                processes.<br>
                <br>
                <i>Reasons for Switching to Apache NetBeans</i>
                <br>
                The main reason is that it is really difficult to integrate with other tools. It is little difficult to
                understand for new developers.

            <h3>Bruce Wayne</h3>
            <p>
                Years ago we traded Netbeans for Eclipse, and Eclipse for VS Code, but in 2020 we decided to test
                Netbeans again. <br>
                In a few weeks of testing we noticed the same problems as always: it's slow, it's big, the screen and
                code editors don't seem to have evolved. <br>
                It seems heavily still focused on older java, leaving plugin implementation for other languages a little
                out of place. <br>
                We were definitely not productive and we couldn't believe that it would be worthwhile to have a project
                in the Netbeans format and trust it in the long run. <br>
                The documentation is highly incomplete and appears to have been mostly generated by javadoc about
                programming comments. Often you don't find what you need.<br>
                <br>
                <i>Pros :</i>
                <br>
                It's free, manages the project in a more professional way, that is, it's more intuitive how you have
                files and folders inside a project, even if it hides or blocks some settings or accesses.<br>
                You have a sense of the "whole" of the project better than some other similar tools.<br>
                It has support for several plugins and does bring some productivity.<br>
                It is still one of the few tools that have a reasonable form editor.<br>
                <br>
                <i>Cons:</i>
                <br>
                It's slow, big and old. The structure and look looks dated, it puts a lot of emphasis on java swing, the
                IDE's tools look the same as when it was still from Sun, and it practically smells musty. <br>
                It's amazing how such a promising project looks like it's been ostracized, it just breathes and it's
                alive, but it doesn't evolve.<br>
                <br>
                <i>Reasons for Choosing Apache NetBeans</i>
                <br>
                If it worked well for us, Netbeans would be an option for us to abandon paid tools, and in this time of
                pandemic that would be crucial for the economy. <br>
                But even for free he made up for the time wasted trying to make things work right. And today, what you
                do on it won't always look the same on your client. <br>
                The result is that it was a test, but it doesn't replace any of our other tools.
